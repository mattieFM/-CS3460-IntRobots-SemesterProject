this folder contains all the data that should be needed for our semester project report. We have all the data from all the runs in the unity_data xcel spreadsheet, then we have my values from homework one where, since I recorded the exact
positions in the trace files, I went back through calulated the velocity of each wheel and then rebuilt their result applying the power use formulas that we found, those are included in homework_data_with_formulas_applied, I did
not include the recordings for those but I could.

In theory the homework and unity data should be in similar units but I would not trust it that heavily, its just there if you want more data points.

I made sure atleast one recording of each algorithm is included.

note: not sure if partial a star is the correct name for it, but its just a star with sensors and constantly repathing once its pathi
is invalidated by a new sensed obstacle appaering in its original path.
